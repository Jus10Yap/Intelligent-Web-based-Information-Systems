Lab Reflection Answers:

1. Discuss the collections and documents that you store in the database (e.g., what data are you storing about products, orders, etc.).
    Products Collection
    - name
    - price
    - dimensions
    - stock
    - reviews

    Orders Collection
    - customer name
    - items : array of objects with two attributes
        - product
        - quantity

2. What is the structure of your new order data? How is it sent to the server (e.g., through an HTML form, JSON request)?
    The structure of the order data consists of a customerName and an array of items. 
    Each item in the array contains a product (which is the product ID) and the quantity for that product.
    The data is sent to the server through an HTML form. When the form is submitted, the data is converted into JSON and sent to the server using a POST request.

3. How do you load the data for a specific order so it can be displayed to the user?
    uses the order's unique ID 

    GET request /orders/:id

    use the Mongoose's .populate() function to get related product documents based on the product IDs present in the order's items array

    pass retrieved data to pug template/file related product documents based on the product IDs present in the order's items array
